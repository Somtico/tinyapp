## Key Features

- User registration and login functionality
- Ability to create short URLs for long URLs

## Routes

The application has the following routes:

- `GET /`: Redirects to `/urls` if the user is logged in, otherwise redirects to `/login`.
- `GET /urls`: Displays a list of URLs created by the logged-in user. If the user is not logged in, redirects to `/login`.
- `GET /urls/new`: Displays a form to create a new short URL. If the user is not logged in, redirects to `/login`.
- `POST /urls`: Handles the submission of the new URL form. If the user is not logged in, redirects to `/login`.
- `GET /urls/:id`: Displays the details of a specific short URL. If the user is not logged in or does not own the URL, shows an error page.
- `POST /urls/:id`: Handles the update of an existing short URL. If the user is not logged in or does not own the URL, shows an error page.
- `POST /urls/:id/delete`: Handles the deletion of an existing short URL. If the user is not logged in or does not own the URL, shows an error page.
- `GET /u/:id`: Redirects the user to the corresponding long URL.
- `GET /register`: Displays the registration form. If the user is already logged in, redirects to `/urls`.
- `POST /register`: Handles the registration form submission. If the email or password is missing, shows an error. If the email already exists, redirects to `/login`.
- `GET /login`: Displays the login form. If the user is already logged in, redirects to `/urls`.
- `POST /login`: Handles the login form submission. If the email or password is missing, shows an error. If the email does not exist or the password is incorrect, shows an error.
- `POST /logout`: Logs out the user by clearing the session and redirecting to `/login`.

## Code Structure

The application is structured into the following files:

- `express_server.js`: Contains the main Express server setup, middleware, and route definitions.
- `helpers.js`: Includes helper functions used throughout the application, such as generating unique IDs, getting user information, and checking user ownership of URLs.
- `database.js`: Contains the `urlDatabase` and `users` objects that store the URLs and user information used by the application.
- `views/`: Contains the EJS templates for rendering the application pages.
- `test/`: Contains code files to test the helper functions and authentication routes. You can run the tests using `npm test`.
